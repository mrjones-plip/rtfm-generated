If you come to work, your project does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community that are interested in that theme. DIY Robot Domination attracts robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night attracts \"Team Low Tech\" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt.\n\n\nYou do not need to be a member to come spend time and acclimate yourself.

Meet our people, and join in the conversation!\n\n\nAccessing the equipment requires you to be a paying member. The dues are set at $ 40 per month. For this price, you gain access to all of our equipment during open hours. If you eventually become a Vetted Member in good standing, you will have access to the shop and its equipment 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n\n\nHow to I get involved?\n\n\nThe best way to get involved with the group is to show up to one of the open nights, join the mailing list/google group, and just participate in\nthings.

It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: \"Let's make stuff awesome!''\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nSYN Shop was started back in 2008, when a bunch of DIY enthusiasts decided that instead of hiding in our garages, workshops and offices, we should instead come together and start a community around the things we are passionate about.\n\n\nWho We Are\n\n\nWe are hackers, makers, artists, innovators, inventors, people of knowledge, and people who want to learn. We are people who take things apart to see how they work. We design the new because it has not been done before, and we reinvent what has already been done for the challenge of doing it ourselves. We're here to discover the unknown. To teach others, and to put our mark on the world by helping others. We're here to form a community of people who come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.\n\n\nWhat We Are Not\n\n\nWe may be hackers, but we are hackers in the same sense that Steve Wozniak or Dean Kamen are hackers. We're not here to break into your ex's cell phone/computer/automobile, etc.. We're not the people who attack and deface web sites, steal people's credit card information, or even identities. In fact many of us work in industries which protect against such people.\n\n\nHow To Get Involved\n\n\nIf you are in the Las Vegas valley area and are interested in the hackerspace idea, sign up to one of our \nMailing Lists\n, or show up to a \nSYN Shop event\n.\n\n\nThe Name\n\n\nWhat does the name \"SYN Shop\" mean, and why do we call ourselves by that name? When computers need to talk to one another over the network, SYN is the first packet sent out during the TCP three-way handshake. Since Hacker Spaces are about communication, we felt this was a good way of symbolizing what we do. You can also say that Syn, could stand for \"Synergy\". Synergy is defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable, which also fits well with the Hacker Space ideals. And lastly since we live in Las Vegas, SYN is a fun play on words and the city's often heard nick name \"Sin City.\"",

When computers need to talk to one another over the network, SYN is the first packet sent out during the TCP three-way handshake. Since Hacker Spaces are about communication, we felt this was a good way of symbolizing what we do. You can also say that Syn, could stand for \"Synergy\". Synergy is defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable, which also fits well with the Hacker Space ideals. And lastly since we live in Las Vegas, SYN is a fun play on words and the city's often heard nick name \"Sin City.\"",

The outputs from the accelerometer axis are hooked directly into the control voltage.\n\n\nAs the accelerometer is moved the output voltage varies between ~.5 and ~2.5 volts representing -1 to +1g on each axis. This causes the duty cycle of the 555 timers to vary between ~40% and ~95%. Since the 555 is being used as a sink for the LEDs, higher duty cycle = dimmer led.\n\n\nEverything is run off 2 3v coin cell batteries wired in parallel. 5v power cannot be applied to this circuit without blowing the accelerometer.\n\n\nPrototype\n\n\nLike most hackers we generally prototype on a solderless breadboard. This presented a bit of a problem for this build as we did not have any of the major components in a breadboard-compatible DIP version.\n\n\nKrux quickly whipped up breakout boards for the surface mount 555 and 556, but the tiny accelerometer gave us a bit more trouble. Not wanting to etch a breakout board, we flipped it over and krux soldered leads directly onto the pads, creating a dead bug breakout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dead bug was then mounted on a piece of perfboard and headers were added to make a\nbreadboard compatible package.\n\n\nMost of the rest of the afternoon was filled with cursing as we tried to figure out how to make the 555 do what we were trying to do. The result was this:\n\n\n\n\nThe smaller breadboard holds just the accelerometer so we could test it without having to move the whole circuit around. Although the small board is an microcontroller dev board, only the solderless breadboard piece is being used. This advancement only came after an hour of frustration caused by wires and other parts flying off the main board as we tried to test.\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is a still of it in action.\n\n\nBoard\n\n\nOnce the prototype was working we went about designing a board that would fit inside a pingpong ball. We knew this would be a daunting task as it would need to be a double sided board with components on both sides in order to fit inside.\n\n\nWe were concerned that we would not be able to etch the board ourselves, specifically the tiny, closely spaced pads needed by the tiny accelerometer.\n\n\nWe ended up printing transparencies and using the photoresist etch method to etch one side of the board, drill alignment holes, and then expose and etch the other side. Krux said it was --the\nbest board he had ever made-- a pretty good board despite the microscopic flaw in one of the traces which caused a significant amount of cursing and debugging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on soldering the accelerometer. Our original plan was to use solder paste and reflow the accelerometer side of the board using an electric skillet. However, due to not being able to obtain decent solder paste locally krux instead placed a bit of solder on each pad, then used a hot air rework station to reflow just the one area. This worked like a charm and you can see the results in the picture above.\n\n\n\n\nThe board mounted inside the pingpong ball. It finally works in the 11th hour, less than 24 hrs before the contest ends. Special thanks to PG who stayed up way past her bedtime to cheer us on and had the idea of putting tape onto the batteries where they overlapped the vias. She was also the control rod to prevent us from collapsing in a fit of rage and cursing.\n\n\nWe had a variety of issues building the actual board. Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer.\n\n\nThough this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.\n\n\nDownloads\n\n\n\n\nSchematic (Eagle)\n  | Full schematic for use with eagle\n\n\nSchematic (PDF)\n  | Same schematic, but in pdf form\n\n\nBoard (Eagle)\n  | Board layout file for eagle\n\n\nBoard Top (PDF)\n  | Board top in pdf format.

As the accelerometer is moved the output voltage varies between ~.5 and ~2.5 volts representing -1 to +1g on each axis. This causes the duty cycle of the 555 timers to vary between ~40% and ~95%. Since the 555 is being used as a sink for the LEDs, higher duty cycle = dimmer led.  Everything is run off 2 3v coin cell batteries wired in parallel. 5v power cannot be applied to this circuit without blowing the accelerometer.",

            "text": "Like most hackers we generally prototype on a solderless breadboard. This presented a bit of a problem for this build as we did not have any of the major components in a breadboard-compatible DIP version.  Krux quickly whipped up breakout boards for the surface mount 555 and 556, but the tiny accelerometer gave us a bit more trouble. Not wanting to etch a breakout board, we flipped it over and krux soldered leads directly onto the pads, creating a dead bug breakout.    The dead bug was then mounted on a piece of perfboard and headers were added to make a\nbreadboard compatible package.  Most of the rest of the afternoon was filled with cursing as we tried to figure out how to make the 555 do what we were trying to do. The result was this:   The smaller breadboard holds just the accelerometer so we could test it without having to move the whole circuit around. Although the small board is an microcontroller dev board, only the solderless breadboard piece is being used. This advancement only came after an hour of frustration caused by wires and other parts flying off the main board as we tried to test.   And here is a still of it in action.",

            "text": "Once the prototype was working we went about designing a board that would fit inside a pingpong ball. We knew this would be a daunting task as it would need to be a double sided board with components on both sides in order to fit inside.  We were concerned that we would not be able to etch the board ourselves, specifically the tiny, closely spaced pads needed by the tiny accelerometer.  We ended up printing transparencies and using the photoresist etch method to etch one side of the board, drill alignment holes, and then expose and etch the other side. Krux said it was --the\nbest board he had ever made-- a pretty good board despite the microscopic flaw in one of the traces which caused a significant amount of cursing and debugging.    A note on soldering the accelerometer. Our original plan was to use solder paste and reflow the accelerometer side of the board using an electric skillet. However, due to not being able to obtain decent solder paste locally krux instead placed a bit of solder on each pad, then used a hot air rework station to reflow just the one area. This worked like a charm and you can see the results in the picture above.   The board mounted inside the pingpong ball. It finally works in the 11th hour, less than 24 hrs before the contest ends. Special thanks to PG who stayed up way past her bedtime to cheer us on and had the idea of putting tape onto the batteries where they overlapped the vias. She was also the control rod to prevent us from collapsing in a fit of rage and cursing.  We had a variety of issues building the actual board. Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer.  Though this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.",
