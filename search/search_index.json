These will all be \nUbuntu 16.04\n instance.  \n\n\nWhy only Ubuntu?\n \n\n\nThe server is running the \nLXD hypervisor\n which uses the Linux Kernel for all guest VMs.  This means you can only run OSes that use the same kernel, like Ubuntu.  \n\n\nWait, I can have a FREE server with my membership!?\n  \n\n\nYes!  However, there are three main limitations:\n\n\n\n\nThese are for personal use only. If you want to do something commercial check out the other VM providers - \nthey start at about $5/mo\n.\n\n\nThis is not a production environment.  We'll try to keep the VMs up 100% of the time, but we don't have fancy hardware like battery back up and there'll likely be outages here and there. Otherwise, these are full VMs where you have root and can install any software that will fit on 1 CPU/512GB RAM and 10GB of disk.  Hack away, hacker!!\n\n\nThese machines are only accessible via SSH.  So, for example, you can not run a web server that is accessible on the internet (though it would be accessible at the shop!)\n\n\n\n\nSo if I can\u2019t run a publicly accessible service, like a web server, what can I do with it?\n\n\nSo, so many things!  The main thing we hope you\u2019ll do is learn about linux and the command line.  However, you could set up a web server which is accessible only at the shop.  You could have nagios server for monitoring your other services.  The world is your (internet not accessible) oyster!!\n\n\nI don't like the command line - do you have a web UI where I can easily do X (where X is install something etc.)?\n\n\nNo!  These are bare VMs that are ripe for the taking.  You need to either A) be versed in the command line to know what your doing or B) have a hankering to learn.  If you ask, we'll be happy to teach you how to set up a server!\n\n\nI'm really concerned about privacy - will my secrets be safe on my server?\n \n\n\nYes and no!\n\n\nYes - we'll ensure the VM can only be access via an SSH key.  We'll keep the host OS up to date.  Likely no one on the internet will gain access to your server.\n\n\nNo - the shop is where the host server is which is porous venue.  Theft is a possibility. Currently the drives of the server are un-encrypted and a motivated attacker could access your data. Caveat Emptor. Or, I guess, Caveat \"Emptor\" as it's free ;)\n\n\nOk, I'm in - how do I sign up?\n \n\n\nEmail \nmrjones@synshop.org\n and supply me with your username you use on synshop.org to pay your membership and your public SSH key.\n\n\nThat all sounds great, but I have more questions/don't know what an SSH key is/need help - what do I do?\n\n\nStill email mrjones@synshop.org!  We'll figure a time when we can help you in person.  We welcome everyone to this service and want to help folks get up and running. Watch out though - you'll be learning stuff ;)",

We're offering a small virtual machine (VM) with 512MB RAM, 1 CPU, 10GB of disk and 1Mbit of network.  These will all be  Ubuntu 16.04  instance.    Why only Ubuntu?    The server is running the  LXD hypervisor  which uses the Linux Kernel for all guest VMs.  This means you can only run OSes that use the same kernel, like Ubuntu.    Wait, I can have a FREE server with my membership!?     Yes!  However, there are three main limitations:   These are for personal use only. If you want to do something commercial check out the other VM providers -  they start at about $5/mo .  This is not a production environment.  We'll try to keep the VMs up 100% of the time, but we don't have fancy hardware like battery back up and there'll likely be outages here and there. Otherwise, these are full VMs where you have root and can install any software that will fit on 1 CPU/512GB RAM and 10GB of disk.  Hack away, hacker!!  These machines are only accessible via SSH.  So, for example, you can not run a web server that is accessible on the internet (though it would be accessible at the shop!)   So if I can\u2019t run a publicly accessible service, like a web server, what can I do with it?  So, so many things!  The main thing we hope you\u2019ll do is learn about linux and the command line.  However, you could set up a web server which is accessible only at the shop.  You could have nagios server for monitoring your other services.  The world is your (internet not accessible) oyster!!  I don't like the command line - do you have a web UI where I can easily do X (where X is install something etc.)?  No!  These are bare VMs that are ripe for the taking.  You need to either A) be versed in the command line to know what your doing or B) have a hankering to learn.  If you ask, we'll be happy to teach you how to set up a server!  I'm really concerned about privacy - will my secrets be safe on my server?    Yes and no!  Yes - we'll ensure the VM can only be access via an SSH key.  We'll keep the host OS up to date.  Likely no one on the internet will gain access to your server.  No - the shop is where the host server is which is porous venue.  Theft is a possibility. Currently the drives of the server are un-encrypted and a motivated attacker could access your data. Caveat Emptor. Or, I guess, Caveat \"Emptor\" as it's free ;)  Ok, I'm in - how do I sign up?    Email  mrjones@synshop.org  and supply me with your username you use on synshop.org to pay your membership and your public SSH key.  That all sounds great, but I have more questions/don't know what an SSH key is/need help - what do I do?  Still email mrjones@synshop.org!  We'll figure a time when we can help you in person.  We welcome everyone to this service and want to help folks get up and running. Watch out though - you'll be learning stuff ;)",

It is driven by the RetinaEngrave (version 2) Windows software which is available as a \nfree download\n from Full Spectrum Engineering. Designs can be started in the software, but often it is better to design images in a graphics program and use the Full Spectrum Engineering Printer Driver to print directly into RetinaEngrave.  To do this, start RetinaEngrave first, and then open your image file to print.\n\n\nRetinaEngrave\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs the sign on the laser cutter says, it has no brain, please use yours.  RetinaEngrave is very simplistic and often will not do things as you expect, or feel are basic.

Some things to keep in mind: \n\n\n\n\nDouble check your design between the program you started in, and RetinaEngrave.  The print driver is not smart, and cuts off sections if it resets to the standard letter size, can scale things when you need exact sizes, and most annoyingly renders solid lines into multiple ones at seemingly random.

The internet will tell you you can make a design on separate layers of a graphics file, and print them separately into RE and they will line up.  The internet lies for this software and this laser cutter.  \n\n\n\n\nYou need two wholly separate files\n\n\nThe only way to make them line up is to put a big black registration square in the upper left, above your design.  A 6mm one will be recognized\n\n\nCut, then flip.  Trying to line up a board to engrave side A then engrave and cut side B is almost impossible to get level.  Instead, engrave and cut on side A, go steal a dental pick from the electronics bin, flip your object over in place, then engrave side B\n\n\nBlue painters tape or masking tape is your friend. Even if you don't need it to cover your surface to prevent burn, after you've engraved side B, sticking a strip of tap across your cutout parts and the board/plastic will let you pick up most, if not all, the pieces at once off the bed.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Adobe Illustrator and RetinaEngrave\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAdobe Illustrator is a fairly common vector art tool, but its not available at SynShop.  The computer hooked up to the laser cutter has both CorelDraw and Inkscape on it if you are familiar with either, though as an Illustrator user I found both to be lacking in features I needed and confusing.  Both of those programs seem to print reasonably well into RetinaEngrave via the Full Spectrum driver, but AI seems to have issues.\n\n\nHelpful Tips and Useful Info:\n\n\n\n\nMake cut lines as thin as it will let you, try 0.001 width stroke lines with no fill\n\n\nRaster lines get weird, you can experiment with width, but double check how it looks in RetinaEngrave, at a certain thickness it decides its not one line, but instead gives you the outline of the space your line took up.\n\n\nIf you plan on doing a raster engrave then vector cut, make your cut lines a lighter color than your raster lines, something like a light blue or green is visible, and will be easier to cut out later.\n\n\nText....is a pain.  No matter what I do, I can't seem to get RetinaEngrave to understand solid letters.  Fortunately for my project, it was a small enough gap that the end result looks like a single engrave line\n\n\nThe saddest truth about using Illustrator is that the safest, most correct way to get it into RetinaEngrave is to print your .ai file without scale adjustment to a PDF.  Don't ask, I don't know, but it makes my head hurt too.\n\n\nOnce you have a .pdf, you can open it and use the PDF reader to print via the Full Spectrum driver\n\n\nMAKE SURE TO SET A PAPER SIZE BIG ENOUGH\n.  I believe its Foxit Reader on the computer hooked up to the laser cutter, and it will happily ignore the contents of the document when the checkbox 'Choose paper source by PDF page size' is checked.  Instead uncheck that and go to the Properties of the Full Spectrum driver and find something larger than the measurement of your design, for instance to get my 12 x 12 design into RetinaEngrave I had to select C size sheet\n\n\nPrinting this way will import the design into RetinaEngrave",

We decided to take a part of this idea and run with it: lit pingpong balls. What are these good for you ask?

The outputs from the accelerometer axis are hooked directly into the control voltage.\n\n\nAs the accelerometer is moved the output voltage varies between ~.5 and ~2.5 volts representing -1 to +1g on each axis. This causes the duty cycle of the 555 timers to vary between ~40% and ~95%. Since the 555 is being used as a sink for the LEDs, higher duty cycle = dimmer led.\n\n\nEverything is run off 2 3v coin cell batteries wired in parallel. 5v power cannot be applied to this circuit without blowing the accelerometer.\n\n\nPrototype\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLike most hackers we generally prototype on a solderless breadboard. This presented a bit of a problem for this build as we did not have any of the major components in a breadboard-compatible DIP version.\n\n\nKrux quickly whipped up breakout boards for the surface mount 555 and 556, but the tiny accelerometer gave us a bit more trouble. Not wanting to etch a breakout board, we flipped it over and krux soldered leads directly onto the pads, creating a dead bug breakout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dead bug was then mounted on a piece of perfboard and headers were added to make a\nbreadboard compatible package.\n\n\nMost of the rest of the afternoon was filled with cursing as we tried to figure out how to make the 555 do what we were trying to do. The result was this:\n\n\n\n\nThe smaller breadboard holds just the accelerometer so we could test it without having to move the whole circuit around. Although the small board is an microcontroller dev board, only the solderless breadboard piece is being used. This advancement only came after an hour of frustration caused by wires and other parts flying off the main board as we tried to test.\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is a still of it in action.\n\n\nBoard\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce the prototype was working we went about designing a board that would fit inside a pingpong ball. We knew this would be a daunting task as it would need to be a double sided board with components on both sides in order to fit inside.\n\n\nWe were concerned that we would not be able to etch the board ourselves, specifically the tiny, closely spaced pads needed by the tiny accelerometer.\n\n\nWe ended up printing transparencies and using the photoresist etch method to etch one side of the board, drill alignment holes, and then expose and etch the other side. Krux said it was --the\nbest board he had ever made-- a pretty good board despite the microscopic flaw in one of the traces which caused a significant amount of cursing and debugging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on soldering the accelerometer. Our original plan was to use solder paste and reflow the accelerometer side of the board using an electric skillet. However, due to not being able to obtain decent solder paste locally krux instead placed a bit of solder on each pad, then used a hot air rework station to reflow just the one area. This worked like a charm and you can see the results in the picture above.\n\n\n\n\nThe board mounted inside the pingpong ball. It finally works in the 11th hour, less than 24 hrs before the contest ends. Special thanks to PG who stayed up way past her bedtime to cheer us on and had the idea of putting tape onto the batteries where they overlapped the vias. She was also the control rod to prevent us from collapsing in a fit of rage and cursing.\n\n\nWe had a variety of issues building the actual board. Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer.\n\n\nThough this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.\n\n\nDownloads\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nSchematic (Eagle)\n  | Full schematic for use with eagle\n\n\nSchematic (PDF)\n  | Same schematic, but in pdf form\n\n\nBoard (Eagle)\n  | Board layout file for eagle\n\n\nBoard Top (PDF)\n  | Board top in pdf format.
